Testing:
Testing is the process of executing a program with the aim of finding errors. To make our software perform well it should be error-free. If testing is done successfully it will remove all the errors from the software. 

Types of Testing:

Unit Testing: 
Testing on the smallest unit of software. It is usually done using sample inputs and expected outputs.

Integration Testing:
it is done at the time of integrating the units(components) which are already tested(unit testing).
types of integration testing:
	black-box testing:It is used for validation. In this we ignore internal working mechanism and focuses on what is the output.
	white-box testing:It is used for verification. In this we focus on internal mechanism i.e.how the output is achieved



Regression Testing:
It is done at the time when a module is updated to make sure the whole component after adding that module works properly.

Smoke Testing:
This test is done to make sure that software under testing is ready or stable for further testing.

Alpha testing:
This is a type of validation testing. It is a type of acceptance testing which is done before the product is released to customers. It is done by the qa team.

Beta Testing:
The beta test is conducted at one or more customer sites by the end-user of the software. This version is released for a limited number of users for testing in a real-time environment.
