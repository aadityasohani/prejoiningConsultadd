Waterfall model:
the process of sdlc is performed from top to bottom.

		planning
		    |
		    v
		designing
		    |
		    v
		  build
		    |
		    v
		   test
		    |
		    v
		  deploy
		    |
		    v
		maintain


Agile Model:
the steps in sdlc are done in iterations (in cycles)

tools like jira and scrum are very useful in this model.


Devops:
continous build, test, deliver, and monitor takes place.
end to end automation is the key here.
jenkins, docker, selenium, centralized version control system(github) plays a big role here.
