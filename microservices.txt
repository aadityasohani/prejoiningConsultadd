Monolithic Architecture failures:
inflexible
unreliable
hard to scale
blocks continous development
slow development
large and complex applications

Microservices:
microservices firstly breaks these barriers of monolytic architecture.
it is an architectureal style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services modelled around a Business domain.


in microservice, each service is self-contained.

features:
small focused
loosely coupled
language independent
bounded context


companies using microservice architecture:

amazon netflix sound-cloud twitter uber etc
