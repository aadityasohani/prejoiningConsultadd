REST API:
Representational state transfer API
it is a standard way to develop api(s). it puts resources or entities in a bunch of uris(uniform resource identifiers). 


it is stateless.(this means both the requestee and the responder don't have to keep track of previous request-responce or the address of each other).


format :

Request
 operation/uri
 header 
 body (payload of data)


Responce
 status code
 responce header 
 body(usually formatted in json format)
